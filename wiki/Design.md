# Design
This is where we are documenting our design process when developing the Quinzical game. In here, we will be discussing
both [UI](#ui) and [UX](#ux), covering:
- [Colour](#color)
- [Layout](#layout)
- [Typography](#typography)
- [Navigation](#navigation)

## UI
### Colour
#### Colour Scheme

This was the first decision that had to be made to form the base of our design. The main requirements were:
- Colours must complement each other well
- Colours had to high contrast so maintain readability and accessibility
- Use no more than 5 different colours (to keep things clean and easy on the eye)

We started off with some research:

<div>
    <img src="./img/kahoot.png" width=200 alt="Kahoot"/>
    <img src="./img/lotto.jpg" width=200 alt="Lotto"/>
    <img src="./img/jeopardy.jpg" width=200 alt="Jeopardy"/>
    <img src="./img/millionaire.jpg" width=200 alt="Who wants to be a millionaire?"/>
</div>
<br>

A main theme that we noticed in these popular game-show/quiz type platforms is the use of purple and bright/bold colours.
So we decided to take inspiration by using purple and complementing it with a brighter and contrasting colour, orange.

#### Sample scenes
<div>
    <img src="../mockups/start.jpg" width=285 alt="Start page"/>
    <img src="../mockups/play-question-board.jpg" width=285 alt="Question board"/>
    <img src="../mockups/practice-1-attempt.jpg" width=285 alt="One attempt left in practice mode"/>
</div>
<br>

Upon mouse-over on the buttons, the cursor turns into a hand so that the user knows that it is clickable. Text colour was chosen such that
it provides enough contrast in the background for it to be readable.

#### Accessibility
Accessibility is very important for those who are visually impaired. For this, we used the Chrome extension, 
[Colorblindly](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorblindly/floniaahmccleoclneebhhmnjgdfijgg?hl=en), to ensure that
all elements of Quinzical are able to be read and distinguished.

<div>
  <img src="./img/achromatopsia.png" alt="Achromatopsia (monochrome)" width=430/>
  <img src="./img/tritanopia.png" alt="Tritanopia (blue-blind)" width=430/>
  <p><b>Left to right</b>: Achromatopsia (Monochrome), Tritanopia (Blue-Blind)</p>
</div>

### Layout
We have also decided to group elements together such as the buttons for each category so that the user intuitively knows which button belongs to which category.

### Typography

## UX
### Navigation
